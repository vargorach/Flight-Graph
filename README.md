# Flight-Graph
The purpose of this code is to create a weighted graph of flights in 
 Australia and to show the vertices, edge array, adjacency list and matrix,
 DFS traversal from Sydney, and the BFS traversal from Melbourne. There is
 no user input and the output as I said is the vertices, edge array,
 adjacency list and matrix, DFS traversal from Sydney, and the BFS traversal
 from Melbourne. How to use this program is just to run it as there is no
 user input. The types of data expected are arrays, lists, integers, and
 strings. The key variables are the edge arrays as they are used as the data
 for the whole program and the vertices array to tell the names of the cities.
 The major algorithms are each printing method as they make it able to see the
 different parts.
